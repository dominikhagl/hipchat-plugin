<div>
    <p>Send notifications to the currently active user. This can be the currently logged user or the user
    which started a build. In case of automatically triggered builds no message will be send.</p>
    <p>The HipChat username will be automatically derived by the full name of the Jenkins user in the same
    way HipChat created it's default mention names, i.e. by removing all spaces and prepending an @. E.g. 
    the notification for the Jenkins user "Foo Bar" will be send to "@FooBar".</p>
    <p>This user always gets notified last in case the mention name could not be derived correctly and the
    API call fails. This way at least all other rooms and users get notified.</p>
